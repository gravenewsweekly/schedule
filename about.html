        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            The **Simple Scheduling App** was created to solve a common problem—**staying organized without complications**.  
            It all started when a group of students, frustrated with juggling multiple tasks,  
            realized that most scheduling tools were either **too complex, too expensive, or overloaded with unnecessary features**.  
            They wanted something **fast, simple, and effective**—so they built it themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            What began as a small project quickly turned into a **fully functional web app** that allows users to  
            **create, manage, and view schedules effortlessly**.  
        </p>

        <h2>Who Built This?</h2>
        <p>
            This website was built by a team of **tech enthusiasts, students, and developers**  
            who believe in **minimalism and efficiency**.  
            Their goal was to create a scheduling tool that focuses on **what matters most—ease of use and accessibility**.
        </p>
        <p>
            By leveraging modern web technologies and **JSONBin as a lightweight database**,  
            they created a **smooth and fast experience** for users without the need for complex server setups.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            We believe in **simplicity, accessibility, and productivity**.  
            Our mission is to provide users with a **no-frills scheduling experience** that allows them to  
            **focus on their tasks rather than managing a complex app**.
        </p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Users **sign up** with a username, email, and password.</li>
            <li>Once logged in, they can **add subjects and time slots** to create their schedule.</li>
            <li>The schedule is **saved securely using JSONBin** and can be accessed anytime.</li>
            <li>The interface is **clean, fast, and easy to use**.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why Choose This App?</h2>
        <p>
            Unlike other scheduling tools that require **manual installations, complicated settings, or premium subscriptions**,  
            our app is designed for **everyone**—whether you are a **student managing your classes**  
            or a **professional organizing your tasks**.
        </p>

        <h2>What’s Next?</h2>
        <p>
            We are continuously improving the platform. Some **upcoming features** include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>**Edit & Delete Schedules** – Manage your tasks better.</li>

            <li>**Mobile Optimization** – A smoother experience for phone users.</li>
        </ul>
